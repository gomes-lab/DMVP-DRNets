# Joint species distribution modeling code and data for Norberg2019 experiment

This is the code and data for Deep Multivariate Probit DRNets for joint species distribution modeling (JSDM) on the 5 species datasets from Norberg2019. 
See the readme.md files in the subdirectory for each model/data description:

- **DATA/** : the datasets from [Norberg et al. 2019].
- **DMVP-DRNets/** : the DMVP-DRNets model
- **HMSC3-HLR-S/** : the state-of-the-art JSDM model HLR-S (also named HMSC3)
