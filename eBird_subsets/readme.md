# Joint species distribution modeling code and data for the subsets of eBird dataset with different scales

This is the code and data for Deep Multivariate Probit DRNets for joint species distribution modeling (JSDM) on the subsets of the eBird dataset with different scales.
See the readme.md files in the subdirectory for each model/data description:

- **DATA/** : the code to generate the subset of the eBird dataset and data for the smallest subset as an example.
- **DMVP-DRNets/** : the DMVP-DRNets model
- **HMSC3-HLR-S/** : the state-of-the-art JSDM model HLR-S (also called HMSC3)
