# eBird experiments dataset

This directory contains the code for preprocessing train and test datasets.

- **preprocess_folder.py** : This script creates the directory structure required for training and testing.

- **gen_data_split.sh** and **gen_data_nosplit.sh** : These scripts are used to preprocess both the eBird data and map inference data. The eBird data is split into training, validation, and test sets, and its corresponding index is also be stored.
